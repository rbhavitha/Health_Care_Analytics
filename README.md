Title: Optimizing Healthcare Quality Through Data-Driven Efficiency - Analysis Of Elective Hip Replacement Surgeries in New York

Problem Statement:
The length of stay (LOS) in healthcare settings significantly affects both costs and patient capacity. This case study aims to analyze the factors that influence LOS for elective hip replacement surgeries, 
with the goal of improving overall healthcare efficiency.

Objectives:
The primary objective of this study is to improve the management of elective hip replacement surgeries by optimizing LOS. Achieving this optimization has two-fold benefits: it reduces healthcare costs, especially
vital in resource-constrained settings, and increases hospital capacity without compromising the quality of care. Through these objectives, this study seeks to elevate healthcare quality across New York, making
elective hip replacement surgeries more efficient, cost-effective, and beneficial for both patients and healthcare providers.
